A fork of Dr. Kobi Zamir's project - hocr (http://hocr.berlios.de/).

For more information, please visit: http://code.google.com/p/qhocr/ (teh Qt4 GUI application) and the original project http://hocr.berlios.de/

This library was forked due to lack of maintenance, name changed to fix the name conflict with Google's HOCR tools project. See
> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCR
> http://code.google.com/p/hocr-tools/

Update: The project is currently non maintained. See (hebrew) http://cucomania.dyndns.info/node/211
